    "### Brief Overview of APIs\n",
    "We will use Application Program Interfaces (APIs) throughout this course as they enable software programs to communicate with each other. The API defines a set of rules that allow the two programs to communicate with each other, and when that communication involves external data structures the API defines:\n",
    "\n",
    " **1. Endpoint (Exposes Data)**\n",
    "   - The URL where the API listens.\n",
    "   - Example: `https://query.wikidata.org/sparql`\n",
    "\n",
    " **2. Request/Response Model (How Data is Sent and Received)**\n",
    "   - Defines the protocol and request method.\n",
    "   - **REST APIs**: `GET`, `POST` over HTTP.\n",
    "   - **SPARQL APIs**: SPARQL Query over HTTP (`GET`/`POST`).\n",
    "   - **Database APIs**: SQL queries over TCP/IP.\n",
    "\n",
    " **3. Data Format (How Data is Structured)**\n",
    "   - **REST APIs**: JSON, XML, CSV.\n",
    "   - **SPARQL APIs**: SPARQL-JSON, RDF/XML, Turtle, N-Triples.\n",
    "   - **Databases**: Tabular data (Relational Tables).\n",
    "   - **GraphQL APIs**: JSON (Custom queries).\n",

    "# What is a Database? \n",

    "Imagine you‚Äôre running a **chemical inventory** for a lab. You could store data in a spreadsheet (`CSV file`), but as the dataset grows, searching, updating, and ensuring accuracy become difficult.

    "# Semantic Web: A Scientific Data Perspective\n",

The Semantic Web allows Python scripts to query machine-readable datasets. This means scientists can directly access structured data on molecules, atmospheric data, physical constants, and more. The key components include:\n",
