    "# Glob Module\n",
    "The glob module in Python is a powerful tool for file and directory pattern matching. It allows you to search for files and directories using wildcard characters, making it easy to find and manipulate multiple files at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features of glob\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pattern Matching**: glob uses Unix shell-style wildcards for pattern matching[1][2].\n",
    "   - `*`: Matches any number of characters\n",
    "   - `?`: Matches any single character\n",
    "   - `[...]`: Matches any character within the brackets\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recursive Searching**: With Python 3.5+, you can use `**` to search recursively through directories[3].\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Built-in Module**: glob is part of Python's standard library, so no additional installation is required[1][4].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Searching with glob\n",
    "\n",
    "To use glob for searching, you typically follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the module: `import glob`\n",
    "2. Use the `glob.glob()` function with a pattern to find matching files or directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to find all Python files in the current directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import glob\n",
    "python_files = glob.glob('*.py')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Searching in the Working Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, glob can search files in the working directory. By default, if you don't specify a path, glob searches in the current working directory[5].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Searching Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks have the `.ipynb` extension, so you can search for them using glob:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "jupyter_notebooks = glob.glob('*.ipynb')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Searching File Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "While glob is primarily used for filename matching, it can be combined with file reading operations to search within files, including Jupyter notebooks[6]. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import glob\n",
    "import json\n",
    "\n",
    "search_term = 'your_search_term'\n",
    "notebooks = glob.glob('*.ipynb')\n",
    "\n",
    "for notebook in notebooks:\n",
    "    with open(notebook, 'r') as f:\n",
    "        nb_content = json.load(f)\n",
    "        for cell in nb_content['cells']:\n",
    "            if cell['cell_type'] == 'code':\n",
    "                if search_term in ''.join(cell['source']):\n",
    "                    print(f\"Found '{search_term}' in {notebook}\")\n",
    "                    break\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This script searches for a specific term within the code cells of Jupyter notebooks in the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that while glob is powerful for file matching, it's not designed for complex text searching within files. For more advanced text searching, you might want to consider using regular expressions or specialized text search libraries[7].\n",

    "Yes, you can definitely create a search function to accomplish what you're looking for. The combination of glob and regular expressions is indeed a great approach for this task.

    "This function does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It uses glob to recursively find all `.ipynb` files in the specified base directory and its subdirectories.\n",
    "2. For each notebook, it reads the content and parses it as JSON.\n",
    "3. It then searches through markdown cells for headers (lines starting with #).\n",
    "4. If the search phrase is found in a header, it adds the notebook and the matching header to the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Place this code in a Jupyter notebook in one of your folders.\n",
    "2. Replace `\"sabbat\"` with the actual path to your main sabbatical folder.\n",
    "3. Replace `\"example\"` with the phrase you want to search for in headers.\n",
    "4. Run the cell, and it will print out all notebooks and headers that contain your search phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows you to search for phrases in headers across all your notebooks efficiently. If you want to search in all text, not just headers, you can modify the regex pattern and remove the header-specific filtering.\n",

    "Certainly! I'd be happy to provide an overview of what happens when you call `my_fun.search_headers()`. Here's a high-level explanation of the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `search_headers()` function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It sets up the base directory (default is ~/sabbat) and prompts the user for:\n",
    "   - A search phrase\n",
    "   - Whether the search should be case-sensitive\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It then calls the `search_notebooks_for_headers()` function with these parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `search_notebooks_for_headers()` does the following:\n",
    "   - Uses `glob` to find all `.ipynb` files in the base directory and its subdirectories.\n",
    "   - For each notebook file:\n",
    "     - Opens the file and reads its content.\n",
    "     - Uses `json` to parse the notebook content (Jupyter notebooks are stored as JSON files).\n",
    "     - Looks for markdown cells within the notebook.\n",
    "     - Within markdown cells, it searches for headers (lines starting with #).\n",
    "     - If it finds headers matching the search phrase, it stores them.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The function returns a dictionary of matching headers for each notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `search_headers()` then prints the results, showing each notebook path and the matching headers found.\n",
    "\n",
    "The role of JSON in this process is crucial because Jupyter notebooks are stored as JSON files. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. In a Jupyter notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each cell (code, markdown, etc.) is represented as a JSON object.\n",
    "- The entire notebook structure, including metadata, is stored in JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using `json.load()`, we're able to read and parse the notebook file, allowing us to access its structure and content programmatically. This enables us to search through the markdown cells for headers without having to manually parse the raw file content.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows for efficient searching across multiple notebooks, treating each notebook as a structured document rather than just a text file."

    "I apologize for the confusion. You're right to question this, as the dictionary isn't explicitly shown in the output. Let's clarify where the dictionary is created and how you can access it.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "To make this dictionary accessible, we can modify the `search_headers` function to return the results instead of just printing them. Here's how you can change it:\n",

    "\n",
    "# Usage:\n",
    "results_dict = my_fun.search_headers()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, `results_dict` will contain the dictionary with notebooks as keys and lists of matching headers as values. You can explore it like this:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# Print all notebook paths\n",
    "print(results_dict.keys())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print headers for a specific notebook\n",

    "    print(f\"Notebook: {notebook}\")\n",
    "    print(f\"Matching headers: {headers}\\n\")\n",
