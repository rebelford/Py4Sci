    "#  Web Scraping and Databases: A Hybrid Approach\n",
    "While web scraping is often used to extract data for immediate use, it does not store it. A powerful workflow would be:\n",
    "- **Scrape data** from online sources.\n",
    "- **Store it in a structured database (SQL or NoSQL)** for long-term analysis.\n",
    "- **Query it later** instead of repeatedly scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Web Scraping as a Data Acquisition Method\n",
    "Web scraping is a method of extracting **external data** from structured or semi-structured sources on the web and transforming it into a usable format. Unlike databases or file storage, web scraping **does not inherently store data**â€”it is a way to retrieve and structure data from the web dynamically. It allows access to **data stored in HTML web pages** that might not be available via an API.\n",

    "### Web Scraping vs. APIs\n",
    "| Feature         | Web Scraping | APIs |\n",
    "|---------------|-------------|------|\n",
    "| **Access** | Extracts data from web pages (HTML tables, text, lists) | Queries structured data from a service (often JSON or XML) |\n",
    "| **Structure** | Often semi-structured (needs parsing) | Well-structured |\n",
    "| **Reliability** | Pages may change, breaking the scraper | More stable (unless API changes) |\n",
    "| **Use Case** | Extracting tables, research data, metadata from articles | Accessing structured datasets (PubChem, NCBI, weather data) |\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, **web scraping is an alternative to APIs when structured access is unavailable**.\n",

    "## Web Scraping as a Bridge from Classical Literature to Structured Data\n",
    "Scientific data has historically been communicated through **journal articles, textbooks, and reports**. Many modern scientific knowledge repositories (e.g., Wikipedia, research databases) still store information in text-based formats rather than structured databases. Web scraping allows you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extract **tabular data** (like chemical properties from Wikipedia or patents).\n",
    "- Retrieve **text-based metadata** (such as author names, abstracts, and citations).\n",
    "- Collect **non-tabular structured information** (like structured web pages with lists of elements).\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying **text parsing, table extraction, and structured storage**, web scraping allows researchers to **convert human-readable content into machine-readable data**.\n"
