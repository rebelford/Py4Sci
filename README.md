# This site is under development
This site will contain files for the Spring 2025 Python for Science class. 
$$Please Note: The first Lesson is a Jupyter Notebook on Installing Jupyter Lab. You can not run it without having Jupyter installed, so I create an HTML Version here: [https://rebelford.github.io/IOCT-TECH/01_aSetUpComputer%20.html](https://rebelford.github.io/IOCT-TECH/01_aSetUpComputer%20.html)

If you have any questions or concerns please contact [Bob Belford](mailto:rebelford@ualr.edu).

One can argue that in the 21st century coding is a critical skill that should be taught to science students, but is often missing in the undergraduate science curriculum, with students having to teach themselves when they enter grad schools or the workplace. The goal of this class is to expose science students to Python and coding with a focus on how to navigate scientific python packages.  

Students will first learn how to run Conda enviroments using miniconda hosted on Linux or Mac OS, and those with Windows machines will use Windows Subsystem Linux. Students will be generating Jupyter Notebooks in a Jupyter Lab in contrast to using a traditional IDE, as our objective is not to create a program but to understand coding and the use of scientific packagers in exploratory studies. Once they have mastered running notebooks in conda environments we will go over pythonic object oriented programming concepts with a goal of understanding classes, type and pythonic data structures.  Once this is done we will use this framework and AIs to explore the capabilities of various scientific data packages. 

Students will be expected to experiment with multiple AIs in this course, and are expected to buy a subscription for the duration of the course. I have subscriptions to [Perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai) and [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) and use them to help develop code and understand how different Python modules and packages work.
## GitHub Directory Descriptions
1. Assignments -  This is where student workbooks will be posted.  When you complete a workbook you should upload it to your UALR Google Drive for grading.
2. Module1-SetUp - This module includes 6 Jupyter Notebook based lesson plans to get you set up and understand how Python and Jupyter Lab runs. There is also an introduction to Git and GitHub. Note, I made an html version of [01-1_SetUpComputer.ipynb](https://rebelford.github.io/IOCT-TECH/01_aSetUpComputer%20.html) because you can not run the notebook and play the embedded video until you have installed Jupyter Lab.  That is, you can't run a lab on installing the lab until after you have installed the lab.
3. Module2-OOPDataStructures - This Module is an introduction to Python Object Oriented Programming and Data Structures. In addition to built-in volatile data structures we cover persistent data structures that reside outside of the python program.
4. Search_Utility - This directory contains a search utility program you can download to your computer and search all the jupyter notebooks in your home directory, or a specified subdirectory of your home directory.

## File Path Hierarchy on my PC
Organizing your files is very important and as you run the modules you should maintain an appropriate directory structure.  Many of the scripts in the modules will create embedded subdirectories within your home directory  and it is important you understand how to navigate this. I am going to share part of the directory hierarchy I have created, both manually and automagically, and how I use the search utility and AI programs like Perplexity and ChatGPT.
