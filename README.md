This site will contain files for the Spring 2025 Python for Science class. If you have any questions or concerns please contact [Bob Belford](mailto:rebelford@ualr.edu).

The goal of this class is to expose physical science students to python and coding with a focus on how to navigate python packages.  Students will first learn how to run conda enviroments using miniconda hosted on Linux or Mac OS, and those with Windows machines will use Windows Subsystem Linux. Then we will go over pythonic object oriented programming with a goal of understanding classes, type and pythonic datastructures.  Once this is done we will use AIs to explore the capabilities of various scientific data packages. Students will be expected to experiment with multiple AIs in this course, but we will probably focus on [Perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai) for several reasons:
1. They have a very inexpensive student account for the PRO edition ($5:00/minth)
2. If I understand right, they are not a LLM that answers your questions, but a LLM that interprets your query, searches the web, and then attempts to interpret the results. This model has many advantages from the perspective of web literacy
   * You see how it is processing your query
   * You are provided citations and the ability to paste them in a Markdown document
3. But probably most of all, **Perplexity is Perplexing**. It is a fantastic tool to have a dialogue with, but like any AI, it is just an AI. And if you think about it, trying to search a web full of misinformation for information is well, perplexing.
