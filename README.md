One can argue that in the 21st century coding is a critical skill that should be taught to science students, but is often missing in the undergraduate science curriculum, with students having to teach themselves when they enter grad schools or the workplace. The goal of this class is to expose science students to Python and coding with a focus on how to navigate scientific python packages.  

Students will first learn how to run Conda enviroments using miniconda hosted on Linux or Mac OS, and those with Windows machines will use Windows Subsystem Linux. Students will be generating Jupyter Notebooks in a Jupyter Lab in contrast to using a traditional IDE, as our objective is not to create a program but to understand coding and the use of scientific packagers in exploratory studies. Once they have mastered running notebooks in conda environments we will go over pythonic object oriented programming concepts with a goal of understanding classes, type and pythonic data structures.  Once this is done we will use this framework and AIs to explore the capabilities of various scientific data packages. 

Students will be expected to experiment with multiple AIs in this course, but we will probably focus on [Perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai) for several reasons:

1. Perplexity offers a very inexpensive student account for the PRO edition ($5:00/month).
2. Perplexity is a Large Language Model (LLM) AI that does not just answer questions based on training data, but is a LLM that interprets your query, searches the web, and then attempts to interpret the results. This model has many advantages from the perspective of web literacy.
   * You see how it is processing your query
   * You are provided citations and the ability to paste them in a Markdown document.
3. But probably most of all, **Perplexity is Perplexing**. It is a fantastic tool to have a dialogue with, but like any AI, it is just an AI. And if you think about it, trying to search a web full of misinformation is well, perplexing.
